# at_ve_doctor

at_ve_doctor is a simple utility than can check the state of the secondaries running in the 
virtual environment (VE) . 
The virtual environment provides the full @platform stack including a @root server and a number of 
preconfigured @signs.

Once the virtual environment is up and running the at_ve_doctor can be run and it will report back the 
state of each of the preconfigured @signs.

Before the @signs are paired with a device they will report as being in a "teapot" once paired and a 
pkam key is in place they will report as "activated".

Activation can be done via the onboarding widget or if you prefer to activate all the @signs 
with predefined pkam keys the pkamLoad script can be run on the supervisor Ui found at 
localhost:9001 when running the VE.
